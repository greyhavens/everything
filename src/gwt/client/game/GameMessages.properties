        civil and/or criminal liability. \

        multiple characters or accounts to undermine or spy on competing parties, \
        or to otherwise manipulate the game environment. \
    <li> play Everything on any server or service that is not provided or \
        authorised by Three Rings. \
    </ol></p> \
  <li> <p>Content.</p> \
     <p><ol> \
     <li> Participatory Content. As part of our interactive approach, Three Rings \
        provides you with certain opportunities to submit your own ideas, text, \
        graphics, plots, characters, feedback and other materials while you \
        participate in the Games, bulletin boards, chat rooms and other \
        activities in the Site or Services (collectively, "Participatory \
        Content"). By submitting any Participatory Content, you represent and \
        warrant that you are the owner of or have the right to post your \
        Participatory Content, and your Participatory Content does not infringe \
        the rights of any third party. You hereby grant Three Rings a perpetual, \
        irrevocable, non-exclusive, sub-licensable, worldwide, royalty-free \
        license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, distribute, publicly \
        display and perform any and all of your Participatory Content in all \
        media now known or later developed. You, and not Three Rings, are \
        entirely responsible for all of your Participatory Content that you \
        upload, post, email or otherwise transmit via the Site, Services or \
        Games. \
     <li> Third Party Content. You acknowledge and agree that the Site, Services \
        and Games contain materials owned by Three Rings and its licensors \
        (including other members), and you agree not to interfere the copyrights, \
        trademarks and other proprietary rights of such parties. You agree that \
        these rights are valid and protected in all media existing now or later \
        developed, and that except as is explicitly provided otherwise, your use \
        of such materials shall be governed by the copyright laws of the United \
        States and other applicable laws. \
     <li> Content Monitoring. As a matter of policy, Three Rings does not \
        manually pre-screen or monitor the content that you or other members may \
        post to the Everything site or game. Three Rings does use automated \
        mechanisms as necessary to filter obscene or vulgar language, mechanisms \
        which are under user control (see the Options panel). Three Rings does \
        reserve the right to monitor all such content, and reserves the right to \
        remove without notice any and all content that Three Rings, in its sole \
        discretion, finds offensive or otherwise objectionable. You are solely \
        responsible, and bear the risk, for evaluating the accuracy, integrity, \
        quality, completeness or utility of any content. Three Rings makes no \
        representations or warranties about the content appearing in Everything \
        Under no circumstances will Three Rings be liable in any way for any \
        content, including but not limited to, for any errors or omissions in any \
        content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of \
        the use of any content posted, emailed or otherwise transmitted via \
        Everything \
     <li> Mature Content. Three Rings has adopted a "MATURE" rating, and parts of \
        the Site, Services and/or Games contain adult or mature content that some \
        users may consider offensive, indecent or objectionable. While Three \
        Rings has established a list of restrictions (section 5) and may in some \
        instances choose to monitor and take action upon inappropriate gameplay, \
        chat or links to the Services, it is possible that at any time there may \
        be language or other material accessible on or through the Site, Services \
        or Games that may be offensive or objectionable to some users. \
     <li> Content Transmission. You understand that the technical processing and \
        transmission of the Services, including your Participatory Content and \
        Public Content, may involve (i) transmissions over various networks; and \
        (ii) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting \
        networks or devices. \
     <li> Links. The Site, Services and Games may provide links to other sites \
        for your convenience only. Three Rings does not control, is not \
        responsible for, does not necessarily endorse and makes no representation \
        about the materials contained at any linked site. If you choose to visit \
        any linked Sites, Three Rings recommends that you review the other site?s \
        terms of use. Three Rings is not responsible for webcasting or any other \
        form of transmission received from any linked site. \
     <li> Auctions and Sales. It is against Three Rings policy to allow accounts, \
        characters, items, or money to be sold for real money on auction sites or \
        otherwise. We will ask auction sites to respect this policy. We will \
        terminate accounts that we believe are in violation of this policy. \
     </ol></p> \
  <li> <p>Idea submission policy. Three Rings and its employees do not accept or \
  consider unsolicited ideas, including but not limited to ideas for advertising \
  campaigns, technology development or product names. Please do not send Three \
  Rings or any of its employees any unsolicited materials, including any artwork \
  or demos. If any area of the site, services or games invites you to submit \
  material, such as a portfolio URL for a job application, such submission shall \
  not be deemed to be unsolicited for purposes of this section 8 ("Idea \
  Submission Policy"). The purpose of this policy is to avoid potential \
  misunderstandings or disputes if Three Rings'' products or marketing strategies \
  might seem similar to ideas submitted to Three Rings. Please note that any \
  material you submit to Three Rings in any manner, aside from examples of prior \
  work as part of a job application, will be deemed your "Participatory Content" \
  and subject to the terms of section 7.1 ("participatory content").</p> \
  <li> <p>Your Account is Your Responsibility. You are solely responsible and \
  entirely liable for all activities conducted through your account and/or your \
  User ID, even if your account has been compromised through no fault of your \
  own. Three Rings encourages you to maintain the confidentiality of your \
  password, and reminds you that you do not have a license to let others use your \
  account. You agree to notify Three Rings immediately in the event your password \
  is lost, stolen, disclosed or compromised. It is not Three Rings'' policy to ask \
  for your password online, and Three Rings suggests that you never respond to an \
  on-line request for your password. You acknowledge that although the Site, \
  Services and/or Games may offer a feature that allows you to "remember" your \
  password and thereby bypass the password protection, this feature makes it \
  possible for third parties to access your account and User ID. Three Rings \
  strongly discourages the use of the password bypass feature, which will in any \
  event be at your own risk.</p> \
  <li> <p>Privacy. You understand that you have no expectation of privacy with \
  respect to your use of the Site, Services or Games, and that all communications \
  made by or received from you may be monitored, preserved and disclosed by Three \
  Rings representatives. You hereby consent to the extraction of hardware system \
  profile data and any data related to operation of the software from any \
  computer that logs on to the Site, Services or Games using your account. You \
  acknowledge and agree that Three Rings will report to law enforcement \
  authorities any actions which may be considered illegal, as well as any reports \
  it receives of such conduct. Three Rings will cooperate fully with law \
  enforcement agencies in any investigation of alleged illegal \
  activity. Specifically, Three Rings may disclose information about you or your \
  Participatory Content if Three Rings has the good faith belief that such \
  disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) \
  enforce the Terms; (c) respond to claims that any your Participatory Content \
  violates the rights of a third party; or (d) protect the rights, property or \
  safety of Three Rings, its members or the public. These Terms are also subject \
  to Three Rings'' general Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by this reference \
  as if set out in full.</p> \
  <li> <p>International Use. Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you \
  agree to comply with all local rules regarding online conduct and acceptable \
  content. Specifically, you agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding \
  the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the \
  country in which you reside.</p> \
  <li> <p>Ownership. Three Rings and its licensors shall at all times retain all \
  right, title and interest in and to the Site, Services and Games, except to the \
  extent of the licenses granted to you hereunder. Three Rings, Everything and \
  other products referenced herein are either trademarks or registered trademarks \
  of Three Rings.</p> \
  <li> <p>Disclaimer of Warranty. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THREE \
  RINGS, ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, \
  EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, \

  OR THAT THE SITE, SERVICES OR GAMES WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED. SOME \
  JURISDICTIONS DO NOT PERMIT THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH \
  EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p> \

  RINGS'' AND ITS AFFILIATES'', LICENSORS'' AND SUBCONTRACTORS'' TOTAL LIABILITY TO \
  YOU ARISING FROM OR IN RELATION TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE SITE, SERVICES OR GAMES \
  SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE TOTAL PAYMENTS MADE BY YOU TO THREE RINGS UNDER THIS \
  AGREEMENT WITHIN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE OCCURRENCE OF THE INCIDENT \
  WHICH GAVE RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION SHALL NOT APPLY TO \
  DAMAGES ARISING FROM DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO PERSONAL OR TANGIBLE PROPERTY \
  IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE SUCH LIMITATION IS PROHIBITED BY LAW.</p> \
  <li> <p>Consequential Damages. IN NO EVENT WILL THREE RINGS, ITS AFFILIATES, \
  LICENSORS OR SUBCONTRACTORS BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY \
  CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF \
  ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY LOSS OF USE OR COSTS OF SUBSTITUTE \

  WHETHER OR NOT THREE RINGS, ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS OR SUBCONTRACTORS WERE \
  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE \
  FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY STATED HEREIN. IN \
  JURISDICTIONS THAT DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR \
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, THREE RINGS'', ITS AFFILIATES'', LICENSORS'' AND \
  SUBCONTRACTORS'' LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p> \
  <li> <p>Indemnification. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Three \
  Rings, its affiliates, licensors and subcontractors from all liabilities, \
  claims and expenses, including attorneys'' fees, arising from or related to your \

  Content or any act or omission by you relating the Site, Services or \

  <li> <p>Termination. Either you or Three Rings may terminate your account and this \
  agreement upon notice at any time without further obligation to the \
  other. Further, Three Rings reserves the right to terminate the Site, Services \
  and/or Games, or any part thereof, at any time without notice and without \
  further obligation to you. IN NO EVENT SHALL YOU BE ENTITLED TO A REFUND OF ANY \
  FEES OR PRORATION THEREOF. UPON TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR ACCESS \
  PRIVILEGES TO THE SITE, SERVICES AND GAMES WILL TERMINATE AND YOU WILL FORFEIT \
  ANY UNUSED ACCESS TIME THAT YOU PURCHASED OR RECEIVED PRIOR TO TERMINATION. A \
  member whose account Three Rings has terminated may not access the Site, \
  Services or Games in any manner or for any reason without Three Rings'' express, \
  prior, written permission. Termination of this agreement shall have no effect \
  on any payment obligation accrued prior to the effective date of \
  termination. The following sections shall survive termination: 7(a) and (b), 8 \
  and 14-20.</p> \
  <li> <p>Amendment. Three Rings may amend the Terms in its sole discretion at any \
  time by posting revised Terms on the Site, and you agree to regularly review \
  the Terms. If any such revision is unacceptable to you, you may terminate your \
  account and this agreement as provided in Section 17 ("Termination"). Your \
  continued access and use of the Site, Services and/or Games seven (7) days \
  after posting of the revised Terms shall constitute your acceptance of the \
  same. Except as expressly set forth herein, the Terms may not otherwise be \
  modified or amended.</p> \
  <li> <p>Reservation of Rights. Three Rings hereby reserves any rights not \
  expressly granted herein.</p> \

  otherwise transfer the rights or obligations granted to you in this agreement, \
  and any such attempted transfer shall be void. If any provision of this \
  agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be \
  reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and such decision \
  shall not affect the enforceability of: (i) such provision under other \
  circumstances, or (ii) the remaining provisions hereof under all \
  circumstances. Three Rings'' failure to enforce at any time any provision of \
  this agreement shall in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of \
  such provision, nor in any way affect the right of any party to enforce each \
  and every such provision thereafter. The express waiver by Three Rings of any \
  provision, condition or requirement of this agreement shall not constitute a \
  waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or \
  requirement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no default, delay or \
  failure to perform on the part of Three Rings shall be considered a breach of \
  this agreement if such default, delay or failure to perform is shown to be due \
  to causes beyond Three Rings'' reasonable control. This agreement is governed by \
  and construed under California law without regard to its conflict of law \
  principles, and you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located \
  in San Francisco County, in the State of California, U.S.A. for the resolution \
  of any dispute arising from or related to this agreement. In any action to \
