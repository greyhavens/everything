faqHeader = Editor Guidelines

faqBrowserTitle = Web Browser

faqBrowser = <p>Be sure to install and use Chrome, Firefox 3.5+, or Safari 4+. \
  Those properly display the custom font used by Everything which you''ll need to see to \
  ensure that your card text fits nicely onto the cards.</p>

faqTaxonomyTitle = Taxonomy

faqTaxonomy = <p>There''s probably already a top-level category that will work for your series. \
  If not, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/inbox/?compose=1&id=540615819">send \
  me a message</a> on Facebook with your proposed top-level category and I''ll work out with \
  you whether you really have discovered a whole new area of things that we somehow missed.</p> \
  <p>Sub-categories will certainly need to be added, so if you think your series \
  fits into a new sub-category go ahead and create it and put your series in it. \
  If it turns out later when we review it that it should be moved, that can be \
  done easily.</p>

faqFactsTitle = Facts Formatting

faqFacts = <p>Avoid allowing your fun facts to trigger a scrollbar. If it does trigger a \
  scrollbar, you''ll have to trim things down a bit so that it fits without \
  scrolling.</p> \
  <p>A good rule of thumb is two lines of text for the description and nine lines of \
  text for the fun facts. If you have a longer description, you need shorter \
  facts.</p>

faqGrammarTitle = Grammar

faqGrammar = <p>Please use complete sentences in card descriptions and for the facts. \
  For example, on a card about Chimpanzees, don''t use "Likes bananas." instead \
  use "They like bananas." or "Chimpanzees like bananas." Also, please be sure to \
  punctuate your complete sentences.</p>

faqSizeTitle = Series Size

faqSize = <p>Aim for a series that''s around 12 cards, but you can go down to 8 if that makes \
  sense. Avoid going lower than 8 unless it''s something very specific like the \
  four seasons. Avoid going over 20 unless again it''s some very well known group \
  of things that doesn''t make sense to split up.</p> \
  <p>Above 20 cards, you should be thinking seriously about splitting things into \
  two or more separate series (for example, the periodic table of elements is \
  split into 8 different series based on the groupings in the table, the US \
  States are split simply into US States I, US States II and US States III).</p>

faqSeriesTitle = Series Name

faqSeries = <p>Try to avoid series names that are exceptionally long. The game will cope as \
  best it can, but very long names will cause text to wrap in places where it \
  doesn''t look good, or obscures the image on a card, which we want to avoid.</p> \
  <p>An example of a great series name:</p> \
  <blockquote class="handwriting">Animals -> Mammals -> Bears</blockquote> \
  <p> Simple and to the point. Longer can be fine too, particularly if it''s only one \
  of the three levels of the taxonomy:</p> \
  <blockquote class="handwriting">Science -> Chemistry -> Alkaline earth metals</blockquote> \
  <p>Try to avoid really long names though as they just don''t fit:</p> \
  <blockquote class="handwriting">Mythology -> Folklore -> Werewolves of Popular \
  Culture</blockquote> \
  <p>Also try to avoid repeating information already displayed in the category or \
  sub-category. So instead of:</p> \
  <blockquote class="handwriting">Science -> Political Science -> Governments</blockquote> \
  <p>we would have:</p> \
  <blockquote class="handwriting">Science -> Political -> Governments</blockquote> \
  <p>However, it can be nice to have a little bit of repetition in some cases to \
  avoid a series name that is very generic. There are places where the series is \
  shown without the taxonomy. If we used:</p> \
  <blockquote class="handwriting">Animals -> Birds -> Extinct</blockquote> \
  <p> this would result in text showing up like "Bob got the Dodo card in the Extinct \
  series." That''s a little unclear, so instead we use: </p> \
  <blockquote class="handwriting">Animals -> Birds -> Extinct Birds</blockquote> \
  <p>Similarly we have:</p> \
  <blockquote class="handwriting">History -> United States -> U.S. Presidents I</blockquote>

faqRarityTitle = Rarity

faqRarity = <p>You get to decide what rarity to assign to each card and how the rarities in \
  your series progress. One thing to bear in mind is that a series is shown in \
  order of lowest to highest rarity, and alphabetically among cards with the same \
  rarity. So if you are trying to achieve a particular ordering for your set when \
  it is viewed in a collection, you''ll have to work within those constraints.</p> \
  <p>Generally aim for no more than two or three cards higher than rarity V and aim \
  for a smooth progression. Something like the following is a good normal \
  progression for a 12 card series:</p> \
  <blockquote class="machine">I, I, I, II, II, III, III, IV, IV, V, VI, VII</blockquote> \
  <p>If you have something especially amazing in your series, feel free to bump your \
  high cards up to IX or X. This is not a hard and fast rule, just a good place \
  to start. Some series look like:</p> \
  <blockquote class="machine">I, I, II, III, IV, VII, X</blockquote> \
  <p>just because that felt right based on the content of the cards.</p>

faqGlyphsTitle = Special Characters

faqGlyphs = <p>Some cards use superscript or subscript numerals or other special characters. \
  Those can be inserted directly into the description and will otherwise work \
  like normal characters.</p> \
  <p>If you''re on a Mac, there''s a special menu item you can pop up "Edit -> Special \
  Characters" that shows a palette of all the myriad fancy characters that you \
  can use in these modern times. Subscript and superscript numerals are hiding in \
  there somewhere (search for "subscript") along with characters from hundreds of \
  foreign languages and oodles of wacky symbols.</p> \
  <p>On Windows it''s a special separate app called Character Map that you access via \
  Start » All Programs » Programs » Accessories » System Tools » Character Map.</p>
