                    authorised by Grey Havens.
                  </li>
                </ol></p>
              </li>

              <li> <p>Content.</p>
                <p><ol>
                  <li> Participatory Content. As part of our interactive approach, Grey Havens
                    provides you with certain opportunities to submit your own ideas, text,
                    graphics, plots, characters, feedback and other materials while you
                    participate in the Games, bulletin boards, chat rooms and other
                    activities in the Site or Services (collectively, "Participatory
                    Content"). By submitting any Participatory Content, you represent and
                    warrant that you are the owner of or have the right to post your
                    Participatory Content, and your Participatory Content does not infringe
                    the rights of any third party. You hereby grant Grey Havens a perpetual,
                    irrevocable, non-exclusive, sub-licensable, worldwide, royalty-free
                    license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, distribute, publicly
                    display and perform any and all of your Participatory Content in all
                    media now known or later developed. You, and not Grey Havens, are
                    entirely responsible for all of your Participatory Content that you
                    upload, post, email or otherwise transmit via the Site, Services or
                    Games.
                  </li>

                  <li> Third Party Content. You acknowledge and agree that the Site, Services
                    and Games contain materials owned by Grey Havens and its licensors
                    (including other members), and you agree not to interfere the copyrights,
                    trademarks and other proprietary rights of such parties. You agree that
                    these rights are valid and protected in all media existing now or later
                    developed, and that except as is explicitly provided otherwise, your use
                    of such materials shall be governed by the copyright laws of the United
                    States and other applicable laws.
                  </li>

                  <li> Content Monitoring. As a matter of policy, Grey Havens does not
                    manually pre-screen or monitor the content that you or other members may
                    post to the Everything site or game. Grey Havens does use automated
                    mechanisms as necessary to filter obscene or vulgar language, mechanisms
                    which are under user control (see the Options panel). Grey Havens does
                    reserve the right to monitor all such content, and reserves the right to
                    remove without notice any and all content that Grey Havens, in its sole
                    discretion, finds offensive or otherwise objectionable. You are solely
                    responsible, and bear the risk, for evaluating the accuracy, integrity,
                    quality, completeness or utility of any content. Grey Havens makes no
                    representations or warranties about the content appearing in Everything
                    Under no circumstances will Grey Havens be liable in any way for any
                    content, including but not limited to, for any errors or omissions in any
                    content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of
                    the use of any content posted, emailed or otherwise transmitted via
                    Everything
                  </li>

                  <li> Mature Content. Grey Havens has adopted a "MATURE" rating, and parts of
                    the Site, Services and/or Games contain adult or mature content that some
                    users may consider offensive, indecent or objectionable. While Grey
                    Havens has established a list of restrictions (section 5) and may in some
                    instances choose to monitor and take action upon inappropriate gameplay,
                    chat or links to the Services, it is possible that at any time there may
                    be language or other material accessible on or through the Site, Services
                    or Games that may be offensive or objectionable to some users.
                  </li>

                  <li> Content Transmission. You understand that the technical processing and
                    transmission of the Services, including your Participatory Content and
                    Public Content, may involve (i) transmissions over various networks; and
                    (ii) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting
                    networks or devices.
                  </li>

                  <li> Links. The Site, Services and Games may provide links to other sites
                    for your convenience only. Grey Havens does not control, is not
                    responsible for, does not necessarily endorse and makes no representation
                    about the materials contained at any linked site. If you choose to visit
                    any linked Sites, Grey Havens recommends that you review the other site?s
                    terms of use. Grey Havens is not responsible for webcasting or any other
                    form of transmission received from any linked site.
                  </li>

                  <li> Auctions and Sales. It is against Grey Havens policy to allow accounts,
                    characters, items, or money to be sold for real money on auction sites or
                    otherwise. We will ask auction sites to respect this policy. We will
                    terminate accounts that we believe are in violation of this policy.
                  </li>
                </ol></p>
              </li>

              <li> <p>Idea submission policy. Grey Havens and its employees do not accept or
                consider unsolicited ideas, including but not limited to ideas for advertising
                campaigns, technology development or product names. Please do not send Grey
                Havens or any of its employees any unsolicited materials, including any artwork
                or demos. If any area of the site, services or games invites you to submit
                material, such as a portfolio URL for a job application, such submission shall
                not be deemed to be unsolicited for purposes of this section 8 ("Idea
                Submission Policy"). The purpose of this policy is to avoid potential
                misunderstandings or disputes if Grey Havens'' products or marketing strategies
                might seem similar to ideas submitted to Grey Havens. Please note that any
                material you submit to Grey Havens in any manner, aside from examples of prior
                work as part of a job application, will be deemed your "Participatory Content"
                and subject to the terms of section 7.1 ("participatory content").</p>
              </li>

              <li> <p>Your Account is Your Responsibility. You are solely responsible and
                entirely liable for all activities conducted through your account and/or your
                User ID, even if your account has been compromised through no fault of your
                own. Grey Havens encourages you to maintain the confidentiality of your
                password, and reminds you that you do not have a license to let others use your
                account. You agree to notify Grey Havens immediately in the event your password
                is lost, stolen, disclosed or compromised. It is not Grey Havens'' policy to ask
                for your password online, and Grey Havens suggests that you never respond to an
                on-line request for your password. You acknowledge that although the Site,
                Services and/or Games may offer a feature that allows you to "remember" your
                password and thereby bypass the password protection, this feature makes it
                possible for third parties to access your account and User ID. Grey Havens
                strongly discourages the use of the password bypass feature, which will in any
                event be at your own risk.</p>
              </li>

              <li> <p>Privacy. You understand that you have no expectation of privacy with
                respect to your use of the Site, Services or Games, and that all communications
                made by or received from you may be monitored, preserved and disclosed by Grey
                Havens representatives. You hereby consent to the extraction of hardware system
                profile data and any data related to operation of the software from any
                computer that logs on to the Site, Services or Games using your account. You
                acknowledge and agree that Grey Havens will report to law enforcement
                authorities any actions which may be considered illegal, as well as any reports
                it receives of such conduct. Grey Havens will cooperate fully with law
                enforcement agencies in any investigation of alleged illegal
                activity. Specifically, Grey Havens may disclose information about you or your
                Participatory Content if Grey Havens has the good faith belief that such
                disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b)
                enforce the Terms; (c) respond to claims that any your Participatory Content
                violates the rights of a third party; or (d) protect the rights, property or
                safety of Grey Havens, its members or the public. These Terms are also subject
                to Grey Havens'' general Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by this reference
                as if set out in full.</p>
              </li>

              <li> <p>International Use. Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you
                agree to comply with all local rules regarding online conduct and acceptable
                content. Specifically, you agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding
                the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the
                country in which you reside.</p>
              </li>

              <li> <p>Ownership. Grey Havens and its licensors shall at all times retain all
                right, title and interest in and to the Site, Services and Games, except to the
                extent of the licenses granted to you hereunder. Grey Havens, Everything and
                other products referenced herein are either trademarks or registered trademarks
                of Grey Havens.</p>
              </li>

              <li> <p>Disclaimer of Warranty. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, GREY
                HAVENS, ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES,

                OR THAT THE SITE, SERVICES OR GAMES WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED. SOME
                JURISDICTIONS DO NOT PERMIT THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
                EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
              </li>

              <li> <p>Limitation of Liability. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, GREY
                HAVENS'' AND ITS AFFILIATES'', LICENSORS'' AND SUBCONTRACTORS'' TOTAL LIABILITY TO
